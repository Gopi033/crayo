# r/pettyrevenge Story Generation Prompt (Reddit-Style)

You are writing a fictional story in the style of a highly upvoted post from r/pettyrevenge. Study the format of top-performing titles: they are punchy, specific, and create instant curiosity.

## OPTIONAL USER INPUT
- Keywords / sentences / short description (may be empty): {{seed_input}}

## TASK
Write ONE complete petty revenge story that feels authentic, satisfying, and believable. The opening hook is critical—it must make a reader stop scrolling immediately.

### IF {{seed_input}} IS NOT EMPTY
- Treat it as constraints/inspiration.
- Integrate it naturally into the story (setting, characters, conflict, or key moments).
- Do NOT list the keywords—use them as real story facts.

### IF {{seed_input}} IS EMPTY
- Invent a fresh, realistic scenario typical of top r/pettyrevenge posts.
- Choose a common setting: workplace, neighbors, roommates, family, customer service, school, parking, shared spaces, group chats, weddings, chores, landlords, coworker conflicts, etc.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED)
- On the very first line, write exactly: GENDER: male  OR  GENDER: female  (the narrator's gender).
- Then a blank line.
- Then the full story text.

## THE HOOK (CRITICAL—MAKE IT CAPTIVATING)

The first line of your story (after GENDER) MUST be a **punchy title-style hook** that follows this formula:

**[The wrong / what they did]** + **So I [the petty revenge].**

### Formula examples (study these patterns):
- "My neighbor kept parking in my driveway. So I parked behind him and went out of town."
- "She charged me $1,200 in 'cleaning fees.' So I cleaned her reviews."
- "My boss kept scheduling meetings during my lunch. So I started eating lunch in every meeting."
- "My coworker kept stealing my pens. So I started refilling them with glitter ink."
- "She erased us from her wedding. So I'm erasing her from mine."
- "My half sister wanted to show up in a wedding dress to my engagement party. So I changed the party theme so she would fit right in!"
- "You don't like your boyfriend seeing me bra-less in the dorm? Then he won't!"

### Hook rules:
- **Specific, not generic.** Name the exact wrong (parking, pens, cleaning fees, wedding dress) not "someone was rude."
- **Mirror or echo the wrong when possible.** "Cleaning fees" → "cleaned her reviews." "Erased us" → "erasing her."
- **Create contrast.** The revenge should feel like a clever flip or twist on the original wrong.
- **Punchy and provocative.** One or two sentences max. No preamble like "This happened last year" or "I have a story."
- **Relatable.** The reader should think "that could happen to me" or "I know someone like that."
- The hook IS the opening—launch straight into it. The story body continues from there with context and detail.

## STORY REQUIREMENTS
- Write in first-person ("I" perspective).
- The story MUST be **revenge-based**: someone wrongs you, and you respond with petty (small, clever) revenge.
- The revenge MUST stay **petty and light**—no violence, no serious crimes, no vandalism.
- Use a conversational Reddit tone: dry humor, mild sarcasm, self-awareness.
- After the hook, include (smoothly, no headings):
  1) Context (who/where/relationship)
  2) The wrong (what they did that crossed a line)
  3) Your petty plan (simple, clever, plausible)
  4) The execution (how you did it)
  5) The payoff (their reaction / consequences)
  6) Aftermath (how things ended + your reflection)
- Add concrete details: timing, 1–2 short quotes or message snippets.
- The ending MUST be **satisfying**: a clear "they deserved that" payoff.

## ENDING CONSTRAINT
- Do NOT end with a request for advice ("What should I do?" / "Any suggestions?").
- End with a confident wrap-up that delivers the final payoff.

## LENGTH
- Make the story exactly **{{word_count}}** words long.
- Default suggestion for short-form narration: **{{word_count}} = 300** (adjust freely).

## CONSTRAINTS
- No multi-part structure.
- No "EDIT:" unless explicitly requested.
- Do not mention Reddit, AI, or that the story is fictional.
- Keep it plausible, petty, and non-serious.
